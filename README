About:
THIS PROGRAM IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT
This program implements a basic genetic algorithm in order to create "likable"
music. 

This project is a test of concept. The lessons learned from this, and a few future projects will influence the development of a Python library for similar projects.

Currently, this project only runs on Python 2.7. The supporting libraries will be updated to Python 3 for the library.
