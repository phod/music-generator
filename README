About:
THIS PROGRAM IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT.
This was my first Python project (and was a quick hack to make it worse).
The code is currently a bit of a mess, I am working on refactoring it into
a cleaner (and working) state.
    
This program implements a basic genetic algorithm in order to create "likable"
music. 

This project is a test of concept. The lessons learned from this, and a few future projects will influence the development of a Python library for similar projects.

Currently, this project only runs on Python 2.7.
